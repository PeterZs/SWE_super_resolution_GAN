This figure is the super resolution result of shallow water equation simulation data. The left is the groundtruth and the right 
is the corresponding generated super resolution result.

Research for SWE simulation dataâ€™s super-resolution using GAN. See https://wtyatzoo.github.io/reports/SWE.pdf for details.
